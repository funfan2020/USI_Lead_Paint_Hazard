# Predicting and Prevent Lead Paint Hazards in NYC

This repo contains the project files for an NYU CUSP 2021 Capstone project done in partnership with the Office of the NY State Attorney General

This project contains various jupyter notebooks and python scripts intended to create and analysis data to solve three key problems

1. Where are children being exposed to lead paint hazards in NYC and what demographic or socio-economic features can predict these occurrences
2. What landlords are responsible for the highest rates of violations
3. What effect has the COVID-19 pandemic had on violation inspection and remediation times.

The python scripts found in the `scripts` folder are meant to build the datasets described by the files in the `DataDictionaries` folder from scratch. After installing the python dependencies documented in `requirements.txt`, you can run these scripts in the correct order by simply running the bash script in `build.sh`.
